## **Objective**: 
Create JUnit 4.0 or 5.0 test cases for the MyCustomString class, focusing on methods that implement the interface (excluding getters/setters). 
Write multiple tests for each method to check specific functionality and ensure correct behavior using assertions or expected exceptions. 
For methods that can throw exceptions, include tests for each expected exception. 
Use @Test(expected = <exception class>) for exception testing and add brief comments to describe each test.

### Tools Used: Java, JUnit 5.0, IntelliJ
